<h1>MuM</h1>
<p>
MuM is an algorithmic composition framework. This framework was developed to facilitate the manipulation of music information, when implementing music composition algorithms. The framework is designed around the concept of “Musical Material”, an open designation for any length of musical information which can be manipulated in order to create more complex musical information. In this sense, music material can be a motive, a melody, a chord, a multi-voiced choral, a complete orchestral piece or a single musical interval. In another words, any data from which a composer could extract musical ideas for new compositions. MuM models this idea in a class of objects which can store any combination of notes and voices.<p>
MuM is based on a discrete concept of sonic events, in which a composition is ultimately represented as organized groups of notes. Furthermore, even though there is support for manipulating and storing timbre information, the main focus is on pitch and rhythm organization. Thus, the framework is not particularly useful for music which is centered on continuous transformation of sound. The framework is built with standard (ANSI) C++. Therefore it is easily portable to various platforms in source code form. Its output may consist of either Csound score files or Standard MIDI Files.<p>
MuM is free software. It may be copied, modified and reused in any way, as long as it retains the credits for the original developers (as noted in this document and in source code) in the derived work's source and documentation files. The original MuM implementation was writen by Carlos Eduardo Mello, at the University of Brasilia.<p>
